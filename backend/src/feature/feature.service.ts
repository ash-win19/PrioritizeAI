Based on this, list and rank 5 to 10 product features that are most important for a first MVP. Assign a custom score between 1â€“10 for each, and give a 1-line explanation.

Respond with valid JSON in this exact format:
{
  "features": [
    {
      "feature": "Feature name",
      "score": 8,
      "explanation": "Brief explanation of why this feature is important for the MVP"

  ]

Focus on features that:
1. Address the core value proposition
2. Can be built quickly to validate the concept
3. Provide immediate user value
4. Support the product vision
5. Are essential for the MVP to function`;
